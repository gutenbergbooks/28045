<p class="bk1"><i>Five millenniums have passed since the loathsome Termans were eliminated from the world of
Diskra.... But what of the other planets?</i></p>

<h1><b><big>WALLS OF ACID</big></b></h1>

<h2><i>BY HENRY HASSE</i></h2>

<p><span class="dcap">Braanol stirred, throbbed</span> sluggishly once, then lay quiescent
as his mental self surged up from the deeps of non-entity.
And gradually he came to know that someone had entered the
room. His <i>room</i>, far beneath the city.</p>

<p>Now he could feel the vibra-currents through the liquids of
the huge tanks where he had lain somnolent for untold aeons.
It was pleasant, caressing. For a moment he floated there,
enjoying to the utmost this strange sensation as the renewed
thought-life-force set his every convolution to pulsing.</p>

<p>"To be once more aware! O gloriously aware!" the
thought came fierce and vibrant. "Once more they have
wakened me&mdash;but how long has it been?" Then curiously:
"And what can they want this time?"</p>

<p>The huge brain was alert now, with a supernal sense of
keening. Tentatively he sent out a thought-potential that
encompassed the room.</p>

<p>"They are afraid!" he sensed. "Two have entered here,
and they are afraid of me. I shall remedy that!"</p>

<p>Braanol lowered his thought-potential to one-eighth of one
magnitude, and felt his mind contact theirs. "Approach, my
children," he said kindly. "You have nothing to fear from
me! I take it you are the imperial messengers sent by her
Supreme Magnificence, the Empress Alaazar?"</p>

<p>He felt the fright slip from their minds. But they were
startled.</p>

<p>"The Empress Uldulla reigns now, fourth in the Royal
line," came the thought. "Empress Alaazar died long ago!"</p>

<p>"I am truly grieved!" Braanol flashed to them. "Alaazar&mdash;may
she rest in peace&mdash;did not neglect me! How well
I remember her interest in the stories I could tell, stories of
the Diskra of old when we sent men out to glorious adventures
on the other planets! Aye! Five millenniums ago it
was that we achieved space travel. In those days&mdash;"</p>

<p>Braanol ceased in his reminiscences, aware that these two
were trying to get their thoughts through to him.</p>

<p>"That is why we have come! The Empress Uldulla, too,
wishes a story. The story of the first space-flight from Diskra,
and the events that brought it about. And of how
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye! Of how <i>I</i> came to be as you see me now! I shall
be delighted, my children, to tell it again. But first, prepare
the trans-telector so that it may be recorded faithfully."</p>

<p>Braanol directed them to a machine on the far side of the
room, and instructed them as to its operation. Soon the
hundreds of tiny coils were humming, and a maze of tubes fed
out of the machine, on which would be recorded Braanol's
every thought. For a moment he paused, gently swaying,
pulsing, a huge independent brain suspended in the pale green
liquid. Then he began his story.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">Your Supreme Beneficence</span>! When the imperial messengers
came to me, bringing the communication with which you
deigned to address my decrepit solitude, it was like a glorious
ray of light come to illumine the deepening darkness of my
declining years!</p>

<p>It is with trepidation that I set about to fulfill your Exalted
Command. Five millenniums, aye, even more, have passed,
since those who were part of that segment of history into
which you inquire, have become but drifting dust. Only
within the feeble memory of your humblest servant is there
any record of it.</p>

<p>Five millenniums! Aye! That was truly the golden period
of our beloved Diskra&mdash;not that our period under <i>Your</i>
Serene Effulgence is not golden indeed! But in that day all
Diskra was under the glorious rule of Palladin. His city on
the scarlet shores of our central sea was the wonder of us
<i>all</i>. Aye! We had a sea then, where there is now but desert.</p>

<p>The intelligent planets were three: our own Diskra, of
course, fourth from the sun. And nearest the sun, Mirla, that
fiery globe, where life apes the quality of our own salamander,
existing by necessity near the flames. And second from
the sun Venia, the cloud-capped world, where life exalts the
virtues of the fish. Of the third planet, Terra, we then knew
little.</p>

<p>Our cities faced the sun in those days, towering in polychromatic
splendor. Height was no obstacle then, for we
had wings&mdash;wings! Think of it, O Beneficence! No need
had we of clumsy, metal vessels. But all that has changed.
Now no whirr of wings disturbs the air, and our formi-tectural
splendors rise <i>within</i>. The history of this change is what
Your Supreme Exaltation would know. This, then, is the
record.</p>

<p>With the rule of Palladin was born the age of science, not
so much due to the intellects of that day, as through the
driving urge of ultimate necessity. For Palladin had a
brother, Thid. He was unfortunately a mutant. Whereas
our features were delicate and quite regular, Thid's were gross
and stamped with power. His royal head was too large and
cumbersome, and instead of our slender waists, he was almost
asymmetrical in shape. In short&mdash;no member of our fairer,
royal sex could look upon him with aught but horror. And
it was because of this that he was dietetically conditioned for
the realm of science.</p>

<p>It was a mistake. As the years passed, the loneliness of his
virtual exile tended to derange Thid's prodigious mind! Aye,
prodigious&mdash;and dangerous in his manic-depressive state.
Then one day Palladin called an emergency meeting of the
Inner Council. I, Braanol, was a member of that Council.</p>

<p>"It has come to my attention," Palladin said, "that Thid
has been carrying on certain dangerous experiments! Experiments
of a sort that could well be inimical to us&mdash;to
our very existence!"</p>

<p>We well knew to what Palladin referred. But Thid was
his brother, one of the Imperial ones. No one dared speak.</p>

<p>"Why was I not made aware of it sooner?" Palladin demanded
sternly. "You, Braanol! You knew of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your majesty." I was frightened. "I beg to explain&mdash;I
have tried to dissuade him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Palladin's visage became less stern, as though he understood
our reluctance in this matter. "True," he said. "Thid is my
brother. He must be mad! And I tell you now: if he has
gone as far in this experiment as I suspect, I shall not hesitate
to apply the only remedy dictated by efficiency&mdash;death!
Have him brought to me at once."</p>

<p>But Thid was nowhere to be found. He had learned of
Palladin's anger, and had fled into the Diskran desert where
the abhorred <i>Termans</i> dwelt in myriads despite all our effort
to eradicate them. These Termans were soft-bodied, subterranean
creatures with an obstinate life-force, and we had
long realized that they might one day be a menace to us.</p>

<p>So into the desert our Thid fled, spurred by the knowledge
that his life was forfeit. For a time, he was naturally
thought dead. Who could survive unprotected the extremes
of heat and cold? And if by a miracle he triumphed over
the elements, how survive the appalling enmity of the Termans,
whose rudimentary brains conceived no mercy?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, startling bits of rumor began to drift in to
our city; rumors that Thid had been seen, <i>leading hordes of
gigantic Termans across the desert wastes</i>!</p>

<p>We laughed, of course, for caravaneers are ever the prey of
sun mirages, and legends are dear to their souls. A legend
was begun concerning Thid. Arriving caravans vied with
each other in fantastic reports. Some had seen him with
immense hordes of the repulsive Termans. Still others had
discovered subterranean labyrinths being built by the Termans
under his command, and had barely escaped with their
lives. And still we laughed, blessed by the constant climate
on the shores of our sea, and the beneficent rule of our
Exalted Palladin.</p>

<p>And then we ceased to laugh. Palladin called together
his Council of Scientists.</p>

<p>"Can it be?" Palladin asked. "Two whole caravans have
vanished on the way to Estka beyond the mountains." And
he told us more, reports that had arrived from other cities.
Survivors had arrived, with the light of madness in their eyes,
babbling some nameless fear. Others had died from ghastly
wounds&mdash;great burns that refused to heal, but spread a kind
of disease through the tissues. I, Braanol, examined some of
these wounds and reported to Palladin.</p>

<p>"Only a perverted, scientific intellect such as Thid's could
have evolved weapons to inflict such wounds!"</p>

<p>"If he has organized the Termans," suggested another
Council Member, "despite their pigmy size, they will become
a menace that cannot be ignored."</p>

<p>"We have delayed too long!" thundered Palladin. "Find
Thid! I command it!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">An army, the greatest</span> ever assembled on Diskra, was sent
forth to hunt out Thid and exterminate the Termans whom
he had managed to organize by heaven only knew what
magic. The planet must be cleansed of that leprous form of
life, else there would be no peace.</p>

<p>But we did not know what depths of horror we were to
plumb. Even now, O Illustrious Empress, reason reels and
totters at the remembrance. <i>I</i> led one fine division of the
Imperial Guards, armored warriors of the first magnitude.
With them I felt able to conquer planets, not to speak of
the trivial-sized Termans.</p>

<p>For many days we trekked, penetrating ever deeper the
Red Desert's heart. But of the abhorred Termans we caught
no sight. There was only the molten downpour of sun by
day, and the desiccating numbness of cold at night. But on
the sixth day, as we encamped near an underground pool located
by our experts&mdash;we encountered the Termans.</p>

<p>The blue wings of dusk were beating down when suddenly,
from every rampart of sand-dune, every crumbling hillock, out
of the very bowels of the planet itself, they came like an avalanche.
They carried slender metal tubes that spewed polychromatic
death at us! Wherever the deadly discharge touched,
would appear horrible burns that ate away the tissues.
But that isn't what paralyzed us. We had known these vermin
to be short of twelve inches tall, but now they reared
monstrously <i>four feet into the air</i>! Their black, hairy limbs
lashed in an ecstasy of murder-lust, their beady eyes gleamed
with fiendish purpose. And they had <i>intelligent leaders</i>!</p>

<p>The sight of these monsters grown to such awful size struck
terror into the hearts of our legion. Nevertheless, we, who
are seven feet tall, towered above them as we fought with the
strength and ferocity of desperation. Every weapon at our
command was brought into play, and they were blasted and
seared by the myriads. Still they came on, blindly, unswervingly,
as if driven by a single prodigious force.</p>

<p>How these life-forms had grown to such bestial proportions
was not known until later. We captured a few and
delicately probed them&mdash;while still alive, of course&mdash;dissecting
their anatomy until we found that some genius had
managed to control their growth through glandular development.
That genius could only have been our Thid!</p>

<p>Soon the desert was covered by a sea of their dead&mdash;and
ours! The stench was unbearable, for the Termans exude an
odor of their own, particularly in death, which is sheer nausea ... but
lest I offend your refined sensibilities, O Serene Empress,
perhaps it were best that I draw a veil of darkness over
that shambles of horror. At last it seemed as if only utter
annihilation of both sides would be the outcome. Already
the battle had lasted for three obeisances of our Diskra to its
parent sun.</p>

<p>And then wisely, our glorious Palladin flashed to us the
command to retreat.</p>

<p>"Already Estka and Kraaj have fallen, with all the populace
wiped out," said the message. "The Termans are converging
upon our capital city! Return here with all haste!"</p>

<p>So it was that we retreated&mdash;those who remained of us&mdash;to
the capitol, and prepared to make a formidable stand. The
other armies of our empire had done likewise. Who would
have thought that this despised, destructive form of life could
ever become such a menace! We remembered one of Thid's
treatises on the noxious pests, in which he had maintained
that they had rudimentary intelligence and an interesting, if
sub-primitive, form of social life. How we had laughed at
the thought of imputing a social order to these subterranean
aphids!</p>

<p>But we weren't laughing now! A race of malignant monsters
had sprung up in the twenty years that Thid had vanished
into the desert.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">Of Thid</span>, nothing more was seen. But we knew he must still exist
somewhere among the Termans. Under that baleful inventive
genius their weapons seemed to multiply, and we were
forced to tax our scientists to the utmost in order to have
weapons, of offense&mdash;and yes, O Beneficence&mdash;defense!</p>

<p>For now, though we had managed to stem their attack on
our capital, they were steadily encroaching on our territory.
Underground lakes and streams were dammed by these fiends.
Vast areas of vegetation were denuded. Precious mines of
rare metals were converted by them, under Thid's direction,
into sources for their ceaseless attacks. Aye! We died a
thousand deaths multiplied a thousand times.</p>

<p>Our ethero-magnum, by which our telepathic vibrations
were amplified for planetary broadcast, became a monotonous
recorder of tragedy as city after city fell to the hordes. For
untold years this savage struggle went on. How well we
realized that this was a war for sole dominance of the planet!</p>

<p>Until at last, only our proud capital by the shores of the
scarlet sea, and its immense valley was left to us.</p>

<p>"We must evolve the principles of inter-spacial travel,"
Palladin told us sadly. "The day may come when we shall
need it."</p>

<p>Hitherto, our rare flights to Venia and Mirla had been
primitive affairs in which the dangerous rocket principle was
employed, with the terrific effects of acceleration crushing the
crews and making landing an even greater hazard than the
flight itself. But now, through inconceivable efforts of
thought&mdash;aye, through sheer desperation!&mdash;our scientists evolved
a system of atomic integration in which free orbital electrons
were utilized to create atomic quantities beyond our
known table, drawing upon the energy that could be harnessed
in the process. It is difficult to describe otherwise than
through pure mathematics&mdash;though if your Serene Effulgence
wishes, I will be happy to describe it to you at a later date; it
will take some little effort to recall the exact formulae.</p>

<p>"We must send an expedition to Terra," Palladin told us.
"From what we have been able to gather astronomically, that
planet seems habitable. Mirla, we know, is out of the question;
it is a holocaust of fire. And to dwell on the semi-aquatic
world of Venia, a new environmental adaptation would be
necessary."</p>

<p>Fantastic, wasn't it, O Exalted Empress, that we the rightful
Lords of Diskra should be compelled to abandon our beloved
homes by a horde of vermin? Indeed it was a tragic
day when the first scientific expedition was assembled. And
I, Braanol, was honored beyond my humble desserts by his
Supreme Magnificence, Palladin. I was assigned as <i>Recorder</i>
on the expedition.</p>

<p>Strapped and cushioned until not an inch of my body
was visible, I was launched into space together with my fellow
scientists, within the spheroid confines of our atomic projectile.
The agony of enduring&mdash;even for seconds&mdash;the required acceleration,
will forever remain in my mind as the ultimate in
torture. But at last the agony was gone, as we traveled at unimaginable
speed toward the planet which we hoped would be
our future home.</p>

<p>No, not hoped&mdash;because meanwhile on Diskra the experiments
with acid gas were going on, in a sort of last-ditch defense
which we hoped might stem the endless hordes!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">It was on the</span> eleventh day that we really saw Terra in its
full prismatic glory. For days it had loomed larger in our
three-dimensional electro-cone, where we studied its continents
and oceans to select the likeliest spot for a landing.
Terra was intensely blue now, rivalling in color the priceless
<i>zafirines</i> of our own Diskra. I hope in the humblest depths
of my mind, O Empress Uldulla, that you shall never know
the unplumbed abyss of loneliness we all felt.</p>

<p>At last we were forced to use the forward atomic beam to
brake our meteoric entrance into the heavy atmosphere. We
had, of course, turned on the neutralizing frigi-rectifiers that
formed a network on the outer shell of our sphere. At last
we were through. Dipping lower as we circled, we discerned
majestic oceans; ice-clad peaks crowning the stark glory of the
landscape, and then more inviting lands criss-crossed by rivers
and studded with shining lakes.</p>

<p>It was to us, O Great Beneficence, a paradise indeed! Entranced,
we all but forgot our landing which would require
the utmost skill. Brunoj, our greatest navigator, was at the
controls, padded and cushioned beyond the possibility of injury.
The rest of us retired to the special crash-room.</p>

<p>I remember we carried in our laboratory, in a special container
of <i>glassaran</i>, two embalmed specimens of the monstrous
Termans. These we were to show as a warning to whatever
race existed here. One glance at the revolting monsters
would have been enough for an intelligent race.</p>

<p>But now that would not be necessary. Terra seemed uninhabited.
We had seen no cities as we circumnavigated the
globe. Had intelligent life-forms failed as yet to materialize on
this verdant world? We assumed that fact, in our joyous eagerness
to feel the good earth beneath us.</p>

<p>"Prepare to land!" came the warning from Brunoj.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">To this day</span> I cannot say what happened. No one knew. For
the brief instant in which I remained conscious, I felt as if Terra
had burst asunder under the terrific impact.</p>

<p>Nor do I know when I finally struggled upward from oblivion;
it may have been hours later, or days. Many among us were
dead. <i>I</i> was a hopelessly crushed horror who still lived somehow,
miraculously. For many days we remained within our
sphere&mdash;disposing of the dead, tending to the injured, conserving
our strength. <i>I</i> might have been destroyed, but with that
frantic will to live which rises within us, I flashed a message to
my companions:</p>

<p>"I still live! Place me in the delocalizer! I will still be of
use!"</p>

<p>This was done. The delocalizer, reacting on the thalamic region
of my brain, intercepted pain currents and allowed me to
exist without <i>physical</i> feeling. Only my mind, lucid and intensely
alive as never before, continued to record the adventure in
this world. It was not until later that my brain was completely
dissevered from my crushed body....</p>

<p>My companions had tested the atmosphere and found no
gasses that might have been inimical to our organisms. Thus
they prepared for the greatest adventure of all&mdash;the emergence.
The locks were opened. A draft of fragrant, if heavy atmosphere
swept through our globe. It was pleasantly invigorating
and bright outside&mdash;so I was told by their telepathic messages,
for I alone remained within.</p>

<p>Telepathically they kept me informed, as they wandered up
the narrow valley. The soil was firm and amazingly fertile.
Vegetation grew thickly everywhere. They reached the far end
of the valley at last, and rocky ramparts towered over them.</p>

<p>Then it was&mdash;how can I begin to describe it to you, Exalted
Empress? From <i>their minds</i>, coming back to me, was a sudden
flood of excited, hysterical thought! It seemed filled with intense
loathing and fear! Imagine me there, if you can&mdash;helpless&mdash;and
in a frenzy of despair wondering what they could
have encountered!</p>

<p>Desperately I extended my potential. I managed to intuit a
fierce battle in which they were engaging. And some of my
companions were dying! Hordes of fierce denizens from the
rocks above were descending upon them. They had taken
weapons along, true&mdash;but I could sense now by their frantic
thought that these war-like creatures of Terra numbered in the
hundreds, with hordes of them swarming from beyond!</p>

<p>For a long while the battle raged, then I sensed that my
companions were retreating. Oh, I was glad! Glad! At least
I would not be left alone. But of the two score who had ventured
out, only <i>six</i> returned. As they operated the lock of the
ship, and tumbled in, I could see&mdash;or rather <i>perceive</i>&mdash;a long
part of the terrain behind them.</p>

<p>Then it was that my mind sickened. <i>For the creatures of this
bright new world were&mdash;Termans!</i> Slightly different from
those we had battled on Diskra, true. These were even more
monstrous, over six feet tall, with long shaggy manes and a reddish
fuzz covering their four limbs ... and O Beneficence, I
swear it&mdash;<i>sickening blue eyes</i>! They walked upright and carried
crude weapons, shafts of wood fitted with sharp-edged
<i>stone</i>!</p>

<p>Not until much later did my returning companions tell me
what they had seen through their telescopic lenses. Just beyond
this valley were vast plains where the Termans seemed to number
in the thousands, huge nomadic tribes of them. There were
other creatures as well, some massive beyond all belief, others
fierce and blood-lusting with huge saber-like teeth.</p>

<p>"We could colonize Terra indeed," was the consensus of our
thoughts, "but at what a price! To be forever battling these
creatures&mdash;particularly the Termans, that abominable <i>genus
Homo</i>...."</p>

<p>Can you imagine, O Empress Uldulla, how the irony of it bit
us? It was almost more than we could bear to think that on
Diskra our own <i>genus Formicae</i> was in life-or-death struggle
with these creatures and we had found them swarming here as
well! All&mdash;all of this lush, verdant world was defiled!</p>

<p>There was nothing we remaining seven could do now. Sadly
we set about repairing the ship, so that we could bear the awful
tidings back to Diskra. And as we sped again toward our beloved
planet, a sombre pall fell upon us. The interchange of
thoughts were brief and tinged with a profound despair.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">This resolved</span> into amazement, however, as we came ever closer
to Diskra. For now, through our telecto-scope we could see
that our planet had been subtly altered! A few symmetrical lines
had appeared on the face of Diskra, as if a cosmic hand had
drawn straight lines across with mathematical precision!</p>

<p>Not until we had safely landed, did we learn the truth. O
joyous news! The hordes of Termans had been repulsed and
were even then being slowly driven back! Our scientists had
created in the laboratories a type of <i>formic acid</i> somewhat similar
to the vesicatory secretion occurring within our own bodies&mdash;but
infinitely more deadly! It had been used as a weapon
against the Termans. And more! Huge walls of gaseous formic
acid, held unwavering by electronic force fields, were being erected.
It was these walls that caused the astronomical illusion
we had seen from space.</p>

<p>The rest, O Illustrious Empress, I believe you know well.
How the Termans never again were able to penetrate our walls.
How we waged war on the detestable creatures for a number of
years until finally no trace of them remained on Diskra.</p>

<p>Aye! Five millenniums have passed since the events I have related.
Five millenniums since my crushed body was done away
with and I was preserved in my rectangle of <i>glassaran</i>, with the
constantly renovated thought-life-fluid kept exquisitely warm.
In this state I have accompanied many another expedition to the
planets, in my capacity of official Recorder. I am but Yours to
command, Exalted Empress, should you wish to hear of them.</p>

<p>But I have a warning! Slowly I have developed a new sense
that needs not eyes, nor ears, nor sense of touch&mdash;no antennae
even, such as I once possessed&mdash;but unites and transcends all
these! And I beg of you in my most abject humility, <i>do not
venture to remove even one formic-acid wall</i>, either from above
or from its depth into the ground. Rather build more! Perceptively
I shudder in the awful remembrance of their occasion,
and the day may come when they will be needed once more.</p>

<p>Thus I warn humbly, and remain Your Supreme Fertility's
most insignificant servant,</p>

<p class="author">Braanol.</p>
